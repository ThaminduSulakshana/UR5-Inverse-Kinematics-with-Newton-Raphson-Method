# UR5 Inverse Kinematics with Newton-Raphson Method
 This repository contains the code and resources needed to solve the inverse kinematics of the UR5 industrial robot using the Newton-Raphson method. The project demonstrates the iterative process of convergence and includes a visualization of the UR5 robot in the CoppeliaSim simulator.
